# Lesson Overview: Building a Smart Carpark System

## Introduction

Start by familiarizing yourself with the City of Moondalup’s initiative to implement a smart parking solution. Understand the components and objectives of the Smart Carpark System, and how your work today will contribute to this innovative project.

## Explore the Scenario

Dive into the provided scenario to grasp the context and requirements of the smart carpark application. Pay attention to the specific functionalities and integrations required for the system to work seamlessly.

## Set Up Your Environment

Ensure your Python development environment is ready and all necessary libraries are installed. Create a new project or workspace to house the code for the smart carpark system.

## Construct the Car Class

Begin by coding the `Car` class, defining attributes such as license plate, car model, and entry and exit times. Implement the constructor and string representation method. This class will be used to represent cars in the carpark.

## Implement the Carpark Class

Proceed to create the `Carpark` class, establishing attributes to manage parking capacity, track cars, and monitor available bays. Develop methods to add and remove cars, ensuring the carpark’s status is updated accordingly.

## Develop the Display Class

Develop the `Display` class, integrating it with the `Carpark` class. This class should be capable of showing the number of available bays and the current temperature, retrieved from an external data file.

## Create Sensor Classes

Define the base `Sensor` class along with the `EntrySensor` and `ExitSensor` subclasses. These classes should simulate the detection of cars entering and exiting the carpark, updating the carpark’s status.

## Integrate and Test

Integrate all the classes, ensuring they work together seamlessly. Simulate car entries and exits, and check the display’s output for accuracy. Conduct thorough unit tests for each class to validate functionality and robustness.

## Apply Best Coding Practices

Throughout the development process, adhere to best coding and documentation practices. Ensure your code is clean, well-commented, and follows the conventions specified.

## Reflect and Document

After successfully implementing the smart carpark system, take time to reflect on the learning objectives and how they were achieved. Document any challenges faced and how they were overcome, as well as two specific unit test cases performed.

## Conclusion

By the end of this session, you will have a functional smart carpark system that reflects your understanding and application of Object-Oriented Programming and unit testing. Ensure all components of the system are well-integrated, and your code adheres to best practices for future maintainability and scalability.
